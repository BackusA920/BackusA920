### 💻 About Me

I'm a web developer and visual creator from Manitowoc, WI. My journey into the world of coding started as away to connect with my 7 year old son who loves to code, and a personal challenge but quickly became a passion. With a love for DIY, photography, and building things from scratch, it only made sense to dive into web development. Someday I would like to make this into a career choice.

I’m currently building projects with:
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (and growing!)
- PC and mobile-friendly websites 🌐
- Creative designs & coding with my son 🧠👩‍👦 (check out our [Mommy & Me](https://backusa920.github.io/MommyandMeWebsite/) project!)
- Making a new project everyday. Practice makes perfect.

I'm always eager to take on new challenges, learn new tools, and collaborate with others in tech.
